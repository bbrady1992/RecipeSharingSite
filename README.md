# RecipeSharingSite

A Flask app for friends to share recipes. 

This is a small project that I'm using to explore web development more. 

The backend is a Flask app that provides a REST API, with Flask-SQLAlchemy providing the ORM. The current database is SQLite, but there are plans to move to MySQL once development is further along.

The frontend will use ReactJS. Design and implementation of the frontend will proceed when the backend REST API is built and thoroughly tested.
